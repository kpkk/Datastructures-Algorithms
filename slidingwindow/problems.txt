Given a string you need to print longest possible substring that has exactly M unique characters. If there is more than one substring of longest possible length, then print any one of them.
Input: Str = “aabbcc”, k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: Max substring can be any one from {“aa” , “bb” , “cc”}.


Input: Str = “aabbcc”, k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Max substring can be any one from {“aabb” , “bbcc”}.


Input: Str = “aabbcc”, k = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: 
There are substrings with exactly 3 unique characters
{“aabbcc” , “abbcc” , “aabbc” , “abbc” }
Max is “aabbcc” with length 6.


Input: Str = “aaabbb”, k = 3
Output: Not enough unique characters
Explanation: There are only two unique characters, thus show error message.
